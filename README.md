Are you tired of shops feeling like a waste of space when you're low on funds or not very exciting if you've already more or less gotten your deck going? Or maybe you just enjoy modded madness?

Well, this mod will hopefully remedy that!

Overview
How does this mod make shops more interesting?

Everything buyable in the shop has received modifiers that increase or decrease their price correlating to their effect. In addition to that, you get a bigger selection of relics and potions to peruse.

The chance for these modifiers to spawn is random, the only guarantees are the increases relic and potion selection and at least 1 modified card.

Although, statistically it is rather common to see at least one modified potion and relic as well as 2 cards.

For examples, please look at the linked steamworkshop page.
